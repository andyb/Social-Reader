“I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,” said Mr. Knightley, “of
this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing.”
</p>

<p id="id1012584"><span id="id109652"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?— why so?”
</p>

<p id="id1012568"><span id="id109660"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I think they will neither of them do the other any good.”
</p>

<p id="id1012593"><span id="id109670"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her
with a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. 
I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. 
How very differently we feel!—Not think they will do each other any
good! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels
about Emma, Mr. Knightley.”
</p>

<p id="id1012598"><span id="id109677"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you,
knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.”
</p>

<p id="id1012595"><span id="id109688"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here,
for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject.  We were speaking
of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma,
that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with. 
Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. 
You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value
of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort
a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used
to it all her life.  I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. 
She is not the superior young woman which Emma’s friend ought to be. 
But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed,
it will be an inducement to her to read more herself.  They will
read together.  She means it, I know.”
</p>

<p id="id1012608"><span id="id109694"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve
years old.  I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at
various times of books that she meant to read regularly through—and
very good lists they were—very well chosen, and very neatly
arranged—sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. 
The list she drew up when only fourteen—I remember thinking it
did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time;
and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now.  But I
have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma. 
She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience,
and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding.  Where Miss Taylor
failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do
nothing.— You never could persuade her to read half so much as you
wished.—You know you could not.”
</p>

<p id="id1012611"><span id="id109701"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I dare say,” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “that I thought
so then;—but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma’s
omitting to do any thing I wished.”
</p>

<p id="id1012614"><span id="id109713"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that,”—said
Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done.  “But I,”
he soon added, “who have had no such charm thrown over my senses,
must still see, hear, and remember.  Emma is spoiled by being the
cleverest of her family.  At ten years old, she had the misfortune of
being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. 
She was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. 
And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house
and of you all.  In her mother she lost the only person able to cope
with her.  She inherits her mother’s talents, and must have been
under subjection to her.”
</p>

<p id="id1012623"><span id="id109720"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on
your recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse’s family and wanted
another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for
me to any body.  I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.”
</p>

<p id="id1012621"><span id="id109726"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Yes,“ said he, smiling.  ”You are better placed here; very fit
for a wife, but not at all for a governess.  But you were preparing
yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. 
You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would
seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from her,
on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will,
and doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend
him a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.“
</p>

<p id="id1012630"><span id="id109733"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Thank you.  There will be very little merit in making a good wife
to such a man as Mr. Weston.”
</p>

<p id="id1012637"><span id="id109744"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away,
and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing
to be borne.  We will not despair, however.  Weston may grow cross
from the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him.”
</p>

<p id="id1012645"><span id="id109750"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I hope not that.—It is not likely.  No, Mr. Knightley, do not
foretell vexation from that quarter.”
</p>

<p id="id1012651"><span id="id109761"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Not I, indeed.  I only name possibilities.  I do not pretend to Emma’s
genius for foretelling and guessing.  I hope, with all my heart,
the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.—But
Harriet Smith—I have not half done about Harriet Smith.  I think
her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. 
She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. 
She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse,
because undesigned.  Her ignorance is hourly flattery.  How can
Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet
is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet,
I will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance. 
Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places
she belongs to.  She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable
with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home. 
I am much mistaken if Emma’s doctrines give any strength of mind,
or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties
of her situation in life.—They only give a little polish.”
</p>

<p id="id1012654"><span id="id109768"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I either depend more upon Emma’s good sense than you do, or am more
anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance. 
How well she looked last night!”
</p>

<p id="id1012663"><span id="id109780"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you?
Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma’s being pretty.”
</p>

<p id="id1012671"><span id="id109792"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Pretty! say beautiful rather.  Can you imagine any thing nearer
perfect beauty than Emma altogether— face and figure?”
</p>

<p id="id1012678"><span id="id109803"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have
seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. 
But I am a partial old friend.”
</p>

<p id="id1012627"><span id="id109815"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Such an eye!—the true hazle eye—and so brilliant! regular features,
open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,
and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!
There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head,
her glance.  One hears sometimes of a child being ‘the picture
of health;’ now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete
picture of grown-up health.  She is loveliness itself.  Mr. Knightley,
is not she?”
</p>

<p id="id1012689"><span id="id109822"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I have not a fault to find with her person,” he replied. 
“I think her all you describe.  I love to look at her; and I
will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain. 
Considering how very handsome she is, she appears to be little
occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.  Mrs. Weston, I am
not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread
of its doing them both harm.”
</p>

<p id="id1012687"><span id="id109828"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its
not doing them any harm.  With all dear Emma’s little faults,
she is an excellent creature.  Where shall we see a better daughter,
or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities
which may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong;
she will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the
right a hundred times.”
</p>

<p id="id1012696"><span id="id109835"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Very well; I will not plague you any more.  Emma shall be an angel,
and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John
and Isabella.  John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore
not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does;
except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children. 
I am sure of having their opinions with me.”
</p>

<p id="id1012699"><span id="id109842"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;
but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,
you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma’s
mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think
any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith’s intimacy being made
a matter of much discussion among you.  Pray excuse me; but supposing
any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy,
it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father,
who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it,
so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself.  It has been so
many years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized,
Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of office.”
</p>

<p id="id1012702"><span id="id109849"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Not at all,” cried he; “I am much obliged to you for it. 
It is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your
advice has often found; for it shall be attended to.”
</p>

<p id="id1012693"><span id="id109861"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy
about her sister.”
</p>

<p id="id1012717"><span id="id109871"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Be satisfied,” said he, “I will not raise any outcry.  I will keep
my ill-humour to myself.  I have a very sincere interest in Emma. 
Isabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a
greater interest; perhaps hardly so great.  There is an anxiety,
a curiosity in what one feels for Emma.  I wonder what will become
of her!”
</p>

<p id="id1012720"><span id="id109877"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“So do I,” said Mrs. Weston gently, “very much.”
</p>

<p id="id1012711"><span id="id109886"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“She always declares she will never marry, which, of course,
means just nothing at all.  But I have no idea that she has yet
ever seen a man she cared for.  It would not be a bad thing for her
to be very much in love with a proper object.  I should like to see
Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good. 
But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom
from home.”
</p>

<p id="id1012727"><span id="id109892"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break
her resolution at present,” said Mrs. Weston, “as can well be;
and while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be
forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties
on poor Mr. Woodhouse’s account.  I do not recommend matrimony
at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.”
</p>

<p id="id1012730"><span id="id109899"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of
her own and Mr. Weston’s on the subject, as much as possible. 
There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma’s destiny, but it
was not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition
which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to “What does Weston
think of the weather; shall we have rain?” convinced her that he
had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield.
