<p id="id1040718"><span id="id582305"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->

It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous
as herself to avoid a meeting.  Their intercourse was painful
enough by letter.  How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!
</p>

<p id="id1040725"><span id="id582315"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed,
without reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied
there was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in
her style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.—
It might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an
angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.
</p>

<p id="id1040728"><span id="id582322"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella’s invitation;
and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,
without resorting to invention.—There was a tooth amiss. 
Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist. 
Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill
health was a recommendation to her—and though not so fond of a
dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet
under her care.—When it was thus settled on her sister’s side,
Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.—
Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was
to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse’s carriage.—It was all arranged,
it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.
</p>

<p id="id1040731"><span id="id582330"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley’s visits; now she
could talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by
that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful,
which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was
near her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance,
be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.
</p>

<p id="id1040734"><span id="id582336"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard’s, or in London, made perhaps
an unreasonable difference in Emma’s sensations; but she could not
think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,
which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.
</p>

<p id="id1040739"><span id="id582343"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place
in her mind which Harriet had occupied.  There was a communication
before her, one which she only could be competent to make—
the confession of her engagement to her father; but she would
have nothing to do with it at present.—She had resolved to defer
the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well.  No additional
agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved—
and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the
appointed time.—A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind,
to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.
</p>

<p id="id1040747"><span id="id582353"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half
an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.—
She ought to go—and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of
their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill. 
It would be a secret satisfaction; but the consciousness of a
similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with
which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate.
</p>

<p id="id1040750"><span id="id582358"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
She went—she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had
not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor
Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,
though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.—
The fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured
of their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.—
She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor
Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.—No; she heard
nothing but the instant reply of, “Beg her to walk up;”—and a moment
afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly
forward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.—
Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging. 
There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every
thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.—
She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very
feeling tone,
</p>

<p id="id1040753"><span id="id582363"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“This is most kind, indeed!—Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible
for me to express—I hope you will believe—Excuse me for being
so entirely without words.”
</p>

<p id="id1040736"><span id="id582375"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words,
if the sound of Mrs. Elton’s voice from the sitting-room had not
checked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly
and all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest
shake of the hand.
</p>

<p id="id1040765"><span id="id582384"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together.  Miss Bates was out,
which accounted for the previous tranquillity.  Emma could have
wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience
with every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness,
she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.
</p>

<p id="id1040758"><span id="id582394"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton’s thoughts,
and understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits;
it was being in Miss Fairfax’s confidence, and fancying herself
acquainted with what was still a secret to other people. 
Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face;
and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing
to attend to the good old lady’s replies, she saw her with a sort
of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently
been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple
and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,
</p>

<p id="id1040769"><span id="id582400"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“We can finish this some other time, you know.  You and I shall
not want opportunities.  And, in fact, you have heard all the
essential already.  I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits
our apology, and is not offended.  You see how delightfully
she writes.  Oh! she is a sweet creature!  You would have doated
on her, had you gone.—But not a word more.  Let us be discreet—
quite on our good behaviour.—Hush!—You remember those lines—
I forget the poem at this moment:
</p>

<p id="id1040774"><span id="id582407"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
        “For when a lady’s in the case,
        ”You know all other things give place.“
</p>

<p id="id1040772"><span id="id582417"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Now I say, my dear, in our case, for lady, read——mum! a word
to the wise.—I am in a fine flow of spirits, an’t I?  But I want
to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.—My representation, you see,
has quite appeased her.“
</p>

<p id="id1040787"><span id="id582432"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
And again, on Emma’s merely turning her head to look
at Mrs. Bates’s knitting, she added, in a half whisper,
</p>

<p id="id1040794"><span id="id582443"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I mentioned no names, you will observe.—Oh! no; cautious as
a minister of state.  I managed it extremely well.”
</p>

<p id="id1040801"><span id="id582454"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma could not doubt.  It was a palpable display, repeated on every
possible occasion.  When they had all talked a little while in harmony
of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,
</p>

<p id="id1040810"><span id="id582464"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is
charmingly recovered?—Do not you think her cure does Perry the
highest credit?—(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.)
Upon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!—
Oh! if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!”—
And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther,
“We do not say a word of any assistance that Perry might have;
not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.—Oh! no;
Perry shall have all the credit.”
</p>

<p id="id1040814"><span id="id582470"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,”
she shortly afterwards began, “since the party to Box Hill. 
Very pleasant party.  But yet I think there was something wanting. 
Things did not seem—that is, there seemed a little cloud upon
the spirits of some.—So it appeared to me at least, but I might
be mistaken.  However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one
to go again.  What say you both to our collecting the same party,
and exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?—
It must be the same party, you know, quite the same party,
not one exception.”
</p>

<p id="id1040817"><span id="id582477"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being diverted
by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed,
from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.
</p>

<p id="id1040820"><span id="id582488"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.—It is impossible
to say—Yes, indeed, I quite understand—dearest Jane’s prospects—
that is, I do not mean.—But she is charmingly recovered.—
How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad.—Quite out of my power.—
Such a happy little circle as you find us here.—Yes, indeed.—
Charming young man!—that is—so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!—
such attention to Jane!”—And from her great, her more than commonly
thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed
that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane,
from the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.—
After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess,
Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,
</p>

<p id="id1040829"><span id="id582494"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long,
that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise;
but, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master. 
He promised to join me here, and pay his respects to you.”
</p>

<p id="id1040803"><span id="id582501"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?—
That will be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like
morning visits, and Mr. Elton’s time is so engaged.”
</p>

<p id="id1040843"><span id="id582514"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.—He really is engaged from morning
to night.—There is no end of people’s coming to him, on some pretence
or other.—The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens,
are always wanting his opinion.  They seem not able to do any thing
without him.—‘Upon my word, Mr. E.,’ I often say, ‘rather you than I.—
I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument,
if I had half so many applicants.’—Bad enough as it is, for I
absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.—I believe
I have not played a bar this fortnight.—However, he is coming,
I assure you:  yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all.”  And putting
up her hand to screen her words from Emma—“A congratulatory visit,
you know.—Oh! yes, quite indispensable.”
</p>

<p id="id1040848"><span id="id582521"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Miss Bates looked about her, so happily!—
</p>

<p id="id1040851"><span id="id582530"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself
from Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together
in deep consultation.—Mr. E. is Knightley’s right hand.”
</p>

<p id="id1040860"><span id="id582543"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, “Is Mr. Elton
gone on foot to Donwell?—He will have a hot walk.”
</p>

<p id="id1040868"><span id="id582554"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. 
Weston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only
of those who lead.—I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing
their own way.”
</p>

<p id="id1040853"><span id="id582568"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Have not you mistaken the day?” said Emma.  “I am almost certain
that the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.—Mr. Knightley
was at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.”
</p>

<p id="id1040883"><span id="id582581"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,” was the abrupt answer,
which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton’s side.—
“I do believe,” she continued, “this is the most troublesome parish
that ever was.  We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.”
</p>

<p id="id1040891"><span id="id582588"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Your parish there was small,” said Jane.
</p>

<p id="id1040895"><span id="id582596"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject
talked of.”
</p>

<p id="id1040902"><span id="id582605"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard
you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;
the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.”
</p>

<p id="id1040910"><span id="id582619"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Ah! you clever creature, that’s very true.  What a thinking brain
you have!  I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make,
if we could be shaken together.  My liveliness and your solidity
would produce perfection.—Not that I presume to insinuate, however,
that some people may not think you perfection already.—But hush!—
not a word, if you please.”
</p>

<p id="id1040913"><span id="id582626"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,
not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw. 
The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted,
was very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.
</p>

<p id="id1040922"><span id="id582638"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Mr. Elton made his appearance.  His lady greeted him with some
of her sparkling vivacity.
</p>

<p id="id1040897"><span id="id582646"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an
encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!—
But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. 
You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.—
Here have I been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies
a sample of true conjugal obedience—for who can say, you know,
how soon it may be wanted?”
</p>

<p id="id1040930"><span id="id582653"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away. 
His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent
object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering,
and the walk he had had for nothing.
</p>

<p id="id1040940"><span id="id582664"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“When I got to Donwell,” said he, “Knightley could not be found. 
Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning,
and the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home
till one.”
</p>

<p id="id1040948"><span id="id582678"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Donwell!“ cried his wife.—”My dear Mr. E., you have not been
to Donwell!—You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.“
</p>

<p id="id1040933"><span id="id582690"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“No, no, that’s to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley
to-day on that very account.—Such a dreadful broiling morning!—
I went over the fields too—(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,)
which made it so much the worse.  And then not to find him at home! 
I assure you I am not at all pleased.  And no apology left, no message
for me.  The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.—
Very extraordinary!—And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. 
Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.—
Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!—Can you
explain it?”
</p>

<p id="id1040959"><span id="id582697"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,
indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.
</p>

<p id="id1040967"><span id="id582706"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I cannot imagine,” said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife
ought to do,) “I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you,
of all people in the world!  The very last person whom one should expect
to be forgotten!—My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you,
I am sure he must.—Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;—
and his servants forgot it.  Depend upon it, that was the case: 
and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all,
I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.—I am sure I
would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard
for any consideration.  And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds
her very cheap indeed.—She promised Wright a receipt, and never
sent it.”
</p>

<p id="id1040970"><span id="id582712"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I met William Larkins,” continued Mr. Elton, “as I got near
the house, and he told me I should not find his master at home,
but I did not believe him.—William seemed rather out of humour. 
He did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he
could hardly ever get the speech of him.  I have nothing to do with
William’s wants, but it really is of very great importance that I
should see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore,
of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk
to no purpose.”
</p>

<p id="id1040957"><span id="id582718"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. 
In all probability she was at this very time waited for there;
and Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression
towards Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.
</p>

<p id="id1040976"><span id="id582730"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined
to attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs;
it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of,
to say,
</p>

<p id="id1040990"><span id="id582740"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. 
Had you not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been
tempted to introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more
openly than might have been strictly correct.—I feel that I should
certainly have been impertinent.”
</p>

<p id="id1040983"><span id="id582746"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh!“ cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought
infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her
usual composure—”there would have been no danger.  The danger
would have been of my wearying you.  You could not have gratified
me more than by expressing an interest—.  Indeed, Miss Woodhouse,
(speaking more collectedly,) with the consciousness which I
have of misconduct, very great misconduct, it is particularly
consoling to me to know that those of my friends, whose good
opinion is most worth preserving, are not disgusted to such a
degree as to—I have not time for half that I could wish to say. 
I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself. 
I feel it so very due.  But, unfortunately—in short, if your
compassion does not stand my friend—“
</p>

<p id="id1040996"><span id="id582753"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,” cried Emma warmly,
and taking her hand.  “You owe me no apologies; and every body to
whom you might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied,
so delighted even—”
</p>

<p id="id1041000"><span id="id582768"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.—
So cold and artificial!—I had always a part to act.—It was a life
of deceit!—I know that I must have disgusted you.”
</p>

<p id="id1040994"><span id="id582781"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Pray say no more.  I feel that all the apologies should be on my side. 
Let us forgive each other at once.  We must do whatever is to be
done quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. 
I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor?”
</p>

<p id="id1041020"><span id="id582787"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Very.“
</p>

<p id="id1041022"><span id="id582794"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you—
just as I begin to know you.”
</p>

<p id="id1041030"><span id="id582805"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. 
I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.”
</p>

<p id="id1041024"><span id="id582815"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,” replied Emma,
smiling—“but, excuse me, it must be thought of.”
</p>

<p id="id1041044"><span id="id582826"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
The smile was returned as Jane answered,
</p>

<p id="id1041048"><span id="id582833"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“You are very right; it has been thought of.  And I will own
to you, (I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living
with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled.  There must be
three months, at least, of deep mourning; but when they are over,
I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for.”
</p>

<p id="id1041052"><span id="id582840"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Thank you, thank you.—This is just what I wanted to be assured of.—
Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!—
Good-bye, good-bye.”
</p>
