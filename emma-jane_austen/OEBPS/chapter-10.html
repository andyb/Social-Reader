<p id="id1031661"><span id="id112404"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->

Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather
to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise;
and on the morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor
sick family, who lived a little way out of Highbury.
</p>

<p id="id1031668"><span id="id112414"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane
leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street
of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode
of Mr. Elton.  A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed,
and then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage,
an old and not very good house, almost as close to the road as it
could be.  It had no advantage of situation; but had been very much
smartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was,
there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without
a slackened pace and observing eyes.—Emma’s remark was—
</p>

<p id="id1031672"><span id="id112421"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“There it is.  There go you and your riddle-book one of these days.”—
Harriet’s was—
</p>

<p id="id1031678"><span id="id112432"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh, what a sweet house!—How very beautiful!—There are the yellow
curtains that Miss Nash admires so much.”
</p>

<p id="id1031685"><span id="id112443"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I do not often walk this way now,” said Emma, as they proceeded,
“but then there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get
intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards
of this part of Highbury.”
</p>

<p id="id1031693"><span id="id112457"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Harriet, she found, had never in her life been within side the Vicarage,
and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors
and probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love,
with Mr. Elton’s seeing ready wit in her.
</p>

<p id="id1031701"><span id="id112468"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I wish we could contrive it,” said she; “but I cannot think
of any tolerable pretence for going in;—no servant that I want
to inquire about of his housekeeper—no message from my father.”
</p>

<p id="id1031641"><span id="id112465"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
She pondered, but could think of nothing.  After a mutual silence
of some minutes, Harriet thus began again—
</p>

<p id="id1031716"><span id="id112491"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married,
or going to be married! so charming as you are!”—
</p>

<p id="id1031723"><span id="id112501"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma laughed, and replied,
</p>

<p id="id1031726"><span id="id112508"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;
I must find other people charming—one other person at least. 
And I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have
very little intention of ever marrying at all.”
</p>

<p id="id1031735"><span id="id112514"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Ah!—so you say; but I cannot believe it.”
</p>

<p id="id1031739"><span id="id112523"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet,
to be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,)
is out of the question:  and I do not wish to see any such person. 
I would rather not be tempted.  I cannot really change for the better. 
If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it.”
</p>

<p id="id1031742"><span id="id112530"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Dear me!—it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!”—
</p>

<p id="id1031745"><span id="id112539"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. 
Were I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing!
but I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature;
and I do not think I ever shall.  And, without love, I am sure I
should be a fool to change such a situation as mine.  Fortune I
do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want: 
I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their
husband’s house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect
to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always
right in any man’s eyes as I am in my father’s.”
</p>

<p id="id1031750"><span id="id112546"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!”
</p>

<p id="id1031754"><span id="id112555"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I
thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly—so satisfied—
so smiling—so prosing—so undistinguishing and unfastidious—
and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me,
I would marry to-morrow. But between us, I am convinced there never
can be any likeness, except in being unmarried.”
</p>

<p id="id1031760"><span id="id112562"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“But still, you will be an old maid! and that’s so dreadful!”
</p>

<p id="id1031758"><span id="id112572"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is
poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! 
A single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous,
disagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls,
but a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable,
and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else.  And the
distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common
sense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income
has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper. 
Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small,
and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross. 
This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good
natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very
much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. 
Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind:  I really believe,
if she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely
to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her:  that is a
great charm.”
</p>

<p id="id1031770"><span id="id112578"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself
when you grow old?”
</p>

<p id="id1031767"><span id="id112588"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great
many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be
more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.
Woman’s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then
as they are now; or with no important variation.  If I draw less,
I shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work.
And as for objects of interest, objects for the affections,
which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which
is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying, I shall
be very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much,
to care about.  There will be enough of them, in all probability,
to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need. 
There will be enough for every hope and every fear; and though my
attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it suits my ideas
of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder.  My nephews
and nieces!—I shall often have a niece with me.”
</p>

<p id="id1031780"><span id="id112595"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Do you know Miss Bates’s niece?  That is, I know you must have
seen her a hundred times—but are you acquainted?”
</p>

<p id="id1031787"><span id="id112606"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes
to Highbury.  By the bye, that is almost enough to put one out
of conceit with a niece.  Heaven forbid! at least, that I should
ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together,
as she does about Jane Fairfax.  One is sick of the very name
of Jane Fairfax.  Every letter from her is read forty times over;
her compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she
does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair
of garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month. 
I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me to death.”
</p>

<p id="id1031790"><span id="id112613"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics
were superseded.  Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses
of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention
and kindness, her counsel and her patience, as from her purse. 
She understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and
their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary
virtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into
their troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance
with as much intelligence as good-will.  In the present instance,
it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit;
and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice,
she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene
as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,
</p>

<p id="id1031777"><span id="id112620"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good.  How trifling they
make every thing else appear!—I feel now as if I could think of
nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet,
who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?”
</p>

<p id="id1031797"><span id="id112627"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Very true,” said Harriet.  “Poor creatures! one can think
of nothing else.”
</p>

<p id="id1031795"><span id="id112637"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,”
said Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep
which ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden,
and brought them into the lane again.  “I do not think it will,”
stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place,
and recall the still greater within.
</p>

<p id="id1031810"><span id="id112643"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh! dear, no,” said her companion.
</p>

<p id="id1031815"><span id="id112651"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
They walked on.  The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend
was passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near
as to give Emma time only to say farther,
</p>

<p id="id1031824"><span id="id112661"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Ah!  Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability
in good thoughts.  Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that
if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers,
it has done all that is truly important.  If we feel for the wretched,
enough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy,
only distressing to ourselves.”
</p>

<p id="id1031817"><span id="id112668"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Harriet could just answer, “Oh! dear, yes,” before the gentleman
joined them.  The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however,
were the first subject on meeting.  He had been going to call
on them.  His visit he would now defer; but they had a very
interesting parley about what could be done and should be done. 
Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them.
</p>

<p id="id1031830"><span id="id112676"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,” thought Emma;
“to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase
of love on each side.  I should not wonder if it were to bring
on the declaration.  It must, if I were not here.  I wish I were
anywhere else.”
</p>

<p id="id1031834"><span id="id112682"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon
afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised
on one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. 
But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet’s
habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that,
in short, they would both be soon after her.  This would not do;
she immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration
to make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete
occupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on,
and she would follow in half a minute.  They did as they were desired;
and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot,
she had the comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken
by a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders,
with her pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield.  To walk by the side
of this child, and talk to and question her, was the most natural
thing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she been
acting just then without design; and by this means the others were
still able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her. 
She gained on them, however, involuntarily:  the child’s pace was quick,
and theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it,
from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them. 
Mr. Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very
pleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on, was beginning
to think how she might draw back a little more, when they both
looked around, and she was obliged to join them.
</p>

<p id="id1031837"><span id="id112689"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;
and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he
was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday’s
party at his friend Cole’s, and that she was come in herself for
the Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the cellery,
the beet-root, and all the dessert.
</p>

<p id="id1031840"><span id="id112699"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“This would soon have led to something better, of course,” was her
consoling reflection; “any thing interests between those who love;
and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. 
If I could but have kept longer away!”
</p>

<p id="id1031843"><span id="id112697"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage
pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into
the house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,
and fall behind to arrange it once more.  She then broke the lace
off short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently
obliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to
put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.
</p>

<p id="id1031851"><span id="id112718"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Part of my lace is gone,” said she, “and I do not know how I am
to contrive.  I really am a most troublesome companion to you both,
but I hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg
leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit
of ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.”
</p>

<p id="id1031854"><span id="id112725"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing
could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into
his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. 
The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied,
and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately
communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed
into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most
comfortable manner.  She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she
found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it. 
It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging
the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it
practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room. 
For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself.  It could
be protracted no longer.  She was then obliged to be finished,
and make her appearance.
</p>

<p id="id1031857"><span id="id112731"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
The lovers were standing together at one of the windows.  It had a
most favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory
of having schemed successfully.  But it would not do; he had not
come to the point.  He had been most agreeable, most delightful;
he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely
followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt,
but nothing serious.
</p>

<p id="id1031861"><span id="id112746"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Cautious, very cautious,” thought Emma; “he advances inch by inch,
and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.”
</p>

<p id="id1031868"><span id="id112757"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished
by her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself
that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both,
and must be leading them forward to the great event.
