<p id="id1039462"><span id="id580170"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->

One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill’s decease,
Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who “could not stay
five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her.”—
He met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did,
in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say,
unheard by her father,
</p>

<p id="id1039465"><span id="id580177"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?—Do, if it
be possible.  Mrs. Weston wants to see you.  She must see you.”
</p>

<p id="id1039453"><span id="id580188"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Is she unwell?”
</p>

<p id="id1039476"><span id="id580196"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“No, no, not at all—only a little agitated.  She would have
ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you alone,
and that you know—(nodding towards her father)—Humph!—Can you come?”
</p>

<p id="id1039483"><span id="id580210"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Certainly.  This moment, if you please.  It is impossible to
refuse what you ask in such a way.  But what can be the matter?—
Is she really not ill?”
</p>

<p id="id1039491"><span id="id580222"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Depend upon me—but ask no more questions.  You will know it
all in time.  The most unaccountable business!  But hush, hush!”
</p>

<p id="id1039498"><span id="id580233"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. 
Something really important seemed announced by his looks;
but, as her friend was well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy,
and settling it with her father, that she would take her walk now,
she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on
their way at a quick pace for Randalls.
</p>

<p id="id1039506"><span id="id580245"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Now,“—said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,—
”now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.“
</p>

<p id="id1039510"><span id="id580257"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“No, no,”—he gravely replied.—“Don’t ask me.  I promised my wife
to leave it all to her.  She will break it to you better than I can. 
Do not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.”
</p>

<p id="id1039518"><span id="id580271"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Break it to me,” cried Emma, standing still with terror.—
“Good God!—Mr. Weston, tell me at once.—Something has happened
in Brunswick Square.  I know it has.  Tell me, I charge you tell
me this moment what it is.”
</p>

<p id="id1039508"><span id="id580285"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“No, indeed you are mistaken.”—
</p>

<p id="id1039529"><span id="id580293"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.—Consider how many of my dearest
friends are now in Brunswick Square.  Which of them is it?—
I charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.”
</p>

<p id="id1039538"><span id="id580307"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Upon my word, Emma.”—
</p>

<p id="id1039541"><span id="id580315"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Your word!—why not your honour!—why not say upon your honour,
that it has nothing to do with any of them?  Good Heavens!—What can
be to be broke to me, that does not relate to one of that family?”
</p>

<p id="id1039550"><span id="id580329"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Upon my honour,” said he very seriously, “it does not.  It is not
in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name
of Knightley.”
</p>

<p id="id1039558"><span id="id580342"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma’s courage returned, and she walked on.
</p>

<p id="id1039562"><span id="id580350"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I was wrong,” he continued, “in talking of its being broke to you. 
I should not have used the expression.  In fact, it does not concern you—
it concerns only myself,—that is, we hope.—Humph!—In short,
my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. 
I don’t say that it is not a disagreeable business—but things might
be much worse.—If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.”
</p>

<p id="id1039566"><span id="id580357"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. 
She asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy,
and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some
money concern—something just come to light, of a disagreeable
nature in the circumstances of the family,—something which the late
event at Richmond had brought forward.  Her fancy was very active. 
Half a dozen natural children, perhaps—and poor Frank cut off!—
This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. 
It inspired little more than an animating curiosity.
</p>

<p id="id1039570"><span id="id580367"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Who is that gentleman on horseback?” said she, as they proceeded—
speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with
any other view.
</p>

<p id="id1039573"><span id="id580365"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I do not know.—One of the Otways.—Not Frank;—it is not Frank,
I assure you.  You will not see him.  He is half way to Windsor
by this time.”
</p>

<p id="id1039586"><span id="id580388"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Has your son been with you, then?”
</p>

<p id="id1039589"><span id="id580396"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh! yes—did not you know?—Well, well, never mind.”
</p>

<p id="id1039594"><span id="id580405"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more
guarded and demure,
</p>

<p id="id1039601"><span id="id580414"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.”
</p>

<p id="id1039607"><span id="id580423"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.—“Well, my dear,”
said he, as they entered the room—“I have brought her, and now
I hope you will soon be better.  I shall leave you together. 
There is no use in delay.  I shall not be far off, if you want me.”—
And Emma distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he
quitted the room,—“I have been as good as my word.  She has not the
least idea.”
</p>

<p id="id1039610"><span id="id580430"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,
that Emma’s uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone,
she eagerly said,
</p>

<p id="id1039618"><span id="id580444"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“What is it my dear friend?  Something of a very unpleasant nature,
I find, has occurred;—do let me know directly what it is. 
I have been walking all this way in complete suspense.  We both
abhor suspense.  Do not let mine continue longer.  It will do you
good to speak of your distress, whatever it may be.”
</p>

<p id="id1039622"><span id="id580450"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Have you indeed no idea?” said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice. 
“Cannot you, my dear Emma—cannot you form a guess as to what you
are to hear?”
</p>

<p id="id1039630"><span id="id580461"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.”
</p>

<p id="id1039635"><span id="id580471"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“You are right.  It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;”
(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.)
“He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. 
It is impossible to express our surprize.  He came to speak to his
father on a subject,—to announce an attachment—”
</p>

<p id="id1039638"><span id="id580478"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
She stopped to breathe.  Emma thought first of herself, and then
of Harriet.
</p>

<p id="id1039645"><span id="id580486"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“More than an attachment, indeed,” resumed Mrs. Weston; “an engagement—
a positive engagement.—What will you say, Emma—what will any
body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax
are engaged;—nay, that they have been long engaged!”
</p>

<p id="id1039653"><span id="id580493"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma even jumped with surprize;—and, horror-struck, exclaimed,
</p>

<p id="id1039658"><span id="id580502"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Jane Fairfax!—Good God!  You are not serious?  You do not mean it?”
</p>

<p id="id1039664"><span id="id580511"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“You may well be amazed,” returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,
and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover—
“You may well be amazed.  But it is even so.  There has been a solemn
engagement between them ever since October—formed at Weymouth,
and kept a secret from every body.  Not a creature knowing it
but themselves—neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.—
It is so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact,
it is yet almost incredible to myself.  I can hardly believe it.—
I thought I knew him.”
</p>

<p id="id1039667"><span id="id580518"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma scarcely heard what was said.—Her mind was divided between
two ideas—her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax;
and poor Harriet;—and for some time she could only exclaim,
and require confirmation, repeated confirmation.
</p>

<p id="id1039675"><span id="id580525"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Well,“ said she at last, trying to recover herself; ”this is a
circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I
can at all comprehend it.  What!—engaged to her all the winter—
before either of them came to Highbury?“
</p>

<p id="id1039683"><span id="id580540"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Engaged since October,—secretly engaged.—It has hurt me,
Emma, very much.  It has hurt his father equally.  Some part
of his conduct we cannot excuse.”
</p>

<p id="id1039596"><span id="id580552"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, “I will not pretend
not to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power,
be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me,
as you are apprehensive of.”
</p>

<p id="id1039697"><span id="id580567"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma’s countenance
was as steady as her words.
</p>

<p id="id1039705"><span id="id580577"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my
present perfect indifference,” she continued, “I will farther tell you,
that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance,
when I did like him, when I was very much disposed to be
attached to him—nay, was attached—and how it came to cease,
is perhaps the wonder.  Fortunately, however, it did cease. 
I have really for some time past, for at least these three months,
cared nothing about him.  You may believe me, Mrs. Weston. 
This is the simple truth.”
</p>

<p id="id1039708"><span id="id580584"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could
find utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done
her more good than any thing else in the world could do.
</p>

<p id="id1039699"><span id="id580593"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,” said she. 
“On this point we have been wretched.  It was our darling wish that you
might be attached to each other—and we were persuaded that it was so.—
Imagine what we have been feeling on your account.”
</p>

<p id="id1039724"><span id="id580600"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of
grateful wonder to you and myself.  But this does not acquit him,
Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. 
What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged,
and with manners so very disengaged?  What right had he to endeavour
to please, as he certainly did—to distinguish any one young woman with
persevering attention, as he certainly did—while he really belonged
to another?—How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?—
How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?—
very wrong, very wrong indeed.”
</p>

<p id="id1039717"><span id="id580607"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine—”
</p>

<p id="id1039731"><span id="id580616"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“And how could she bear such behaviour!  Composure with a witness!
to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,
before her face, and not resent it.—That is a degree of placidity,
which I can neither comprehend nor respect.”
</p>

<p id="id1039741"><span id="id580622"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said
so expressly.  He had not time to enter into much explanation. 
He was here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation
which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay—
but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said. 
The present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them;
and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the
impropriety of his conduct.”
</p>

<p id="id1039729"><span id="id580629"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Impropriety!  Oh!  Mrs. Weston—it is too calm a censure. 
Much, much beyond impropriety!—It has sunk him, I cannot say how
it has sunk him in my opinion.  So unlike what a man should be!—
None of that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth
and principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man
should display in every transaction of his life.”
</p>

<p id="id1039747"><span id="id580636"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been
wrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer
for his having many, very many, good qualities; and—”
</p>

<p id="id1039751"><span id="id580649"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Good God!” cried Emma, not attending to her.—“Mrs. Smallridge, too! 
Jane actually on the point of going as governess!  What could he
mean by such horrible indelicacy?  To suffer her to engage herself—
to suffer her even to think of such a measure!”
</p>

<p id="id1039765"><span id="id580656"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“He knew nothing about it, Emma.  On this article I can fully
acquit him.  It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated
to him—or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.—
Till yesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans. 
They burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message—
and it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project
of hers, which determined him to come forward at once, own it
all to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in short,
put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been
carrying on so long.”
</p>

<p id="id1039749"><span id="id580662"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma began to listen better.
</p>

<p id="id1039771"><span id="id580670"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I am to hear from him soon,” continued Mrs. Weston.  “He told me
at parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which
seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. 
Let us wait, therefore, for this letter.  It may bring many extenuations. 
It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are
not to be understood.  Don’t let us be severe, don’t let us be in
a hurry to condemn him.  Let us have patience.  I must love him;
and now that I am satisfied on one point, the one material point,
I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well, and ready
to hope that it may.  They must both have suffered a great deal
under such a system of secresy and concealment.”
</p>

<p id="id1039776"><span id="id580676"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“His sufferings,” replied Emma dryly, “do not appear to have done
him much harm.  Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?”
</p>

<p id="id1039784"><span id="id580688"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Most favourably for his nephew—gave his consent with scarcely
a difficulty.  Conceive what the events of a week have done
in that family!  While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there
could not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;—but scarcely
are her remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is
persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required. 
What a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!—
He gave his consent with very little persuasion.”
</p>

<p id="id1039787"><span id="id580694"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Ah!“ thought Emma, ”he would have done as much for Harriet.“
</p>

<p id="id1039773"><span id="id580703"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light
this morning.  He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates’s, I fancy,
some time—and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get
back to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever,
that, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.—
He was very much agitated—very much, indeed—to a degree that made
him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen
him before.—In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of
finding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of—
and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.”
</p>

<p id="id1039794"><span id="id580710"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on
with such perfect secresy?—The Campbells, the Dixons, did none
of them know of the engagement?”
</p>

<p id="id1039798"><span id="id580722"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.
</p>

<p id="id1039808"><span id="id580730"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“None; not one.  He positively said that it had been known to no
being in the world but their two selves.”
</p>

<p id="id1039816"><span id="id580741"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Well,“ said Emma, ”I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled
to the idea, and I wish them very happy.  But I shall always
think it a very abominable sort of proceeding.  What has it been
but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,—espionage, and treachery?—
To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity;
and such a league in secret to judge us all!—Here have we been,
the whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves
all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the
midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting
in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both
to hear.—They must take the consequence, if they have heard each
other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!“
</p>

<p id="id1039819"><span id="id580747"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I am quite easy on that head,” replied Mrs. Weston.  “I am
very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other,
which both might not have heard.”
</p>

<p id="id1039810"><span id="id580760"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“You are in luck.—Your only blunder was confined to my ear,
when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.”
</p>

<p id="id1039833"><span id="id580771"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“True.  But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss
Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her;
and as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.”
</p>

<p id="id1039842"><span id="id580784"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,
evidently on the watch.  His wife gave him a look which invited
him in; and, while he was coming round, added, “Now, dearest Emma,
let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his
heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match. 
Let us make the best of it—and, indeed, almost every thing may
be fairly said in her favour.  It is not a connexion to gratify;
but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it
may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean,
that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness
of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for—
and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this
one great deviation from the strict rule of right.  And how much
may be said in her situation for even that error!”
</p>

<p id="id1039845"><span id="id580794"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Much, indeed!” cried Emma feelingly.  “If a woman can ever
be excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation
like Jane Fairfax’s.—Of such, one may almost say, that ‘the
world is not their’s, nor the world’s law.’”
</p>

<p id="id1039835"><span id="id580792"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,
exclaiming,
</p>

<p id="id1039860"><span id="id580805"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! 
This was a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity,
and exercise my talent of guessing.  But you really frightened me. 
I thought you had lost half your property, at least.  And here,
instead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one
of congratulation.—I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart,
on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished
young women in England for your daughter.”
</p>

<p id="id1039854"><span id="id580812"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was
as right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits
was immediate.  His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: 
he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered
on the subject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted
time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing. 
His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence,
or smooth objections; and by the time they had talked it all
over together, and he had talked it all over again with Emma,
in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly reconciled,
and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could
possibly have done.
